Hello! In this blog I describe and implement in Python some data structures and algorithm I found interesting. 

I am a machine learning engineer looking for work in AI alignment.

Previously, I participated in SERI MATS 2023 winter program, worked at DeepSpin in Germany, and worked at MainsLab in Russia.

I got my Masters degree in Data Science from Skoltech and my Bachelors degree in Mathematics from HSE.

My github is github.com/malyasova and you can reach me at
